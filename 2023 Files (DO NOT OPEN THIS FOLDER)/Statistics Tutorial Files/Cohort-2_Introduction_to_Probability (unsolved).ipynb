    "#### Random Experiments: \n",
    "*  Any process of observation is referred to as an experiment. The results of an observation are called the outcomes of the experiment. An experiment is called a random experiment if its outcome cannot be predicted.\n",
    "##### Examples: Roll of a die, the toss of a coin, drawing a card from a deck, or selecting a message signal for transmission from several messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Space:\n",
    "* A collection of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called  sample space. It is denoted by S.\n",
    "##### Example: A coin is tossed once, then sample space is\n",
    "                S = {H, T}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Event:\n",
    "* Any subset of the sample space S is called an event.\n",
    "                \n",

    "#### Probability\n",
    "* The probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event to happen. The formula for probability is given by\n",
